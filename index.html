        <p>My favourite hobby is doing coding in my free time because I like to make apps and websites. I learned coding from whitehatjr. and now i can code very well and make games and apps. I practice coding everday after school.I've been interested in technology (mainly computers and other electronics) and programming for quite a while now. And although I enjoy programming as a hobby very much, I have some doubts of going into programming / software development as a career. Instead I'm aiming towards other computer careers like consulting or computer security. </p>
